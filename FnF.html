            <h1>HEY!</h1>
            
            <p>Welcome to the Family and Friends section. Here I plan to provide recent information for my family and my friends.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Exams</h2>
            <p>As most of you know, I am rather difficult to contact before or during my Exams. That's why I wanted to communicate them in advance. <br>
                I will have my next exam period from mid july to mid august so thats a time whereI might be diffucult to reach. <br>
                Thanks for understanding.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Summer Holidays and NRW</h2>
            <p>After the exams, the summer holidays will start. It is very likely that I will be in NRW around end of August or beginning of September.
                Unlike last summer I will only come for a short period of time, as I plan to start my Bachelor thesis in the summer holidays.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>General Plan for Study and life</h2>
            <p>Currently the plan for my studies is to finish my bachelor within the next 2 semesters. For that I will write my Bachelor thesis throughout this winter. <br>
                That will mean that I won't have any exams this winter. After the winter I might go on studying the masters degree Mathematics in data science. 
                But it might as well be that I leave university. I will see that. <br>
                <br>
                I am thankful for all of my family and friends that stand by me as I take these important steps in my life.</p>
