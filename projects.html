            <h2><a href="Projects/Rent_markdown.html">Real Estate Data Analysis</a></h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Many Germans complain about rising rents and how they influence their living standards. 
                Coming from a family of real estate investors, real estate was always something I was very interested in.
                But the real estate market is very intransparent, and I wanted precise numbers. 
                So, I tried to understand how high rents in Germany actually are, how they developed over time, and why people complain about high rent prices.
                Using the data from the "Statistisches Bundesamt" (Engl. Federal Statistical Office) I was actually able to show that rent prices in Germany
                were falling, but that there are other reasons why germans pay more for their rent now than they did before.
                If you are interested, you can find my analysis via <a href="Projects/Rent_markdown.html"> this link</a>.

            <p>If you know/have an interesting dataset about real estate in europe, feel free to write me, I am always looking for new and interesting real estate data.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>The Cyclistic Case Study is a challenge about a fictiv Company with real world data. <br>
                Cyclistic is a bike sharing company with annual paying members and casual users. <br>
                The task is to find differences in how these customer types use the Cyclistic services <br>
                and make suggestions for Cyclistics upcoming advertisement campaign. <br>
                The data was publicly made available <a href="https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html">here</a> by Motivate International Inc. under the following <a href="https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement">licence</a>.
