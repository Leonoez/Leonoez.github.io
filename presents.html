            <h1>HEY!</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the interactive wishlist. If you are in search for a present for me you are right here.</p>
            <h2>How does this work?</h2>
            <p>In the lower half of this website a google docs document is going to load. Feel free to use it if you only want to have a look around, 
                or just search for ideas. If at some point you decided on something from the list, mark it as bought. <br>
                To do that, use <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EF9bfPWcnt2G_J1cBujPuDn0tIOh5R-LLcRw0emoTo8/edit?usp=sharing">this link</a>
                to access the original document. Please don't write or delete anything. If you want to mark something as bought, mark it as <del>crossed out</del>. 
                To do that mark the text and press "alt+shift+5" ("⌘ + Shift + X" on MAC) or use the menu via "Format > Text > Strikethrough". <br>
                When I actually received that present I will completely take it out of the list.
                The local copy on this website will update automatically within a couple of minutes/ after refreshing the website.<br>
                (You have an idea how do do a better interactive wishlist in html and css, feel free to write me about it to leonoez@web.de)
            </p>

    What I wish for the most:

	What I actually wish for the most is an annual “Waking Up” Subscription.
What is that?
I love meditating, I do it every day, often even more than once. For that I use an App called “Waking Up”, developed by a Neuroscientist called Sam Harris. Over the years I have tried several apps, but I always return to Sam Harris. I read his books, watched his talks, and I love his app. It is so, so much better than any other I have ever used. It has only one downside… It costs 120$ per year. 
I love this app. And right I struggle a bit with that.
So if you want to help me with that a bit,
